# Discovering the Joy of Curiosity

Today, I had an extraordinary realization about myself. Out of nowhere, I remembered some of the questions I used to ask my sister about the world, like, "If Earth is an oblate spheroid floating in space, then why doesn't its ocean escape its surface?", "If the Sun has such strong gravity, then why don't all the planets fall into it?", and "If Earth and the Moon both have gravity, why haven't they collided yet?" At the time, my sister was in 9th grade, so it's clear now why she couldn't answer them. However, what's remarkable is that today, I know the mathematically correct answers to these questions, but it's too late.

I realized that curiosity should be satisfied immediately when it arises, just like how we respond to social media notifications. The problem is that we're so hooked on social media that we start scrolling through our phones even when we're bored. This may be why we have more "social media influencers" than scientists and pioneers. Social media doesn't fail to deliver on its promises, but curiosity often does. People don't get their answers, and they're forced to study what others want them to study. This is why hardly anyone reads research papers when they're bored. It's incredibly challenging to keep your curiosity alive in the world we live in today.

I say this because I've been through it myself. When I received my first payment of 300 Rupees for creating a simple program, I was ecstatic. I thought that if making money was this easy and rewarding, I could do it forever. I got caught up in work I didn't want to do. But now I realize that I'm not meant to make money. I can live a happy, fulfilling life without having a lot of money. I don't want to be restless all the time. All I want to do is learn and discover new things. I want to study and understand how the universe works. I'm not too old to change course and pursue my true passion.

My responsibility isn't to change the world, but to fundamentally understand it. If that understanding leads to a change in the world, then so be it. I'm not afraid of being called a nerd or wearing a lab coat and goggles. Lab coats and goggles aren't about changing the world; they're about peacefully studying it and discovering new things. As one of my idols, Prof. Richard Feynman, once said, "It's fun to find things out." We haven't fully appreciated the beauty of nature yet. Money can buy anything in the world, but a curious mind can experience everything in the universe.

I'm not saying that Steve Jobs accomplished less than Albert Einstein. They both did what they were good at and what they wanted to do. However, I'm choosing to pursue my passion for science and learning. My greatest fear is being on my deathbed with insufficient knowledge. Nothing can replace the feeling of not knowing enough.

In conclusion, we must always be mindful of our curiosity and nourish it, for it is what fuels our thirst for knowledge and understanding of the world around us. The allure of instant gratification offered by social media and money can be tempting, but we must resist these distractions and follow our true passions. Whether we aspire to be scientists, artists, writers, or any other pursuit that ignites our curiosity, we must stay committed to our path and continue to learn, study, and appreciate the beauty of nature. Let us not fear being called "nerds" or "lab coats and goggles" for pursuing our passions. Rather, let us embrace the wonder of the universe and find joy in discovering its mysteries. For in the end, it is our pursuit of knowledge that will bring us the greatest sense of fulfillment and purpose in life.
